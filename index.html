          <p>State of the Arts is <strong>an anonymous census-style survey for visual artists</strong> intended to help artist gather and have free open
            access to critical information regarding trends in the arts communities of which they are a part. The goal of the survey is
            to assist artists in practical decision making and aid them in building a more inclusive, sustainable and vibrant art
            world by giving them free access to this information.</p>
          <p>The <strong>2019</strong> iteration of the survey was organized with the assistance of a small group of graduates from the San
            Francisco Art Institute and the Yale School of Art. It spanned <strong>89 questions</strong> including but not
            limited to those that addressed the following.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What <strong>cities</strong> are artists living in?</li>
            <li>What kinds of <strong>jobs</strong> are we working?</li>
            <li>What <strong>subjects</strong> are we making work about?</li>
            <li>What <strong>mediums</strong> are we using?</li>
            <li>How are we <strong>selling</strong> our work?</li>
            <li>How are we <strong>getting shows</strong> ?</li>
            <li>How are we <strong>connecting</strong> with eachother?</li>
            <li>In what ways are we <strong>struggling</strong> ?</li>
            <li>In what ways are we <strong>thriving</strong> ?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For this first beta version of the survey we are proud to have had <strong>over 100 participants</strong> from across the United States that took the
            survey before December 31st 2019. <strong>Participation is still welcome</strong> however if you wish to fill out the survey with information from your 2019 studio year.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>If you would like to contribute ideas for the 2020 survey</strong> please don't hesitate to <strong>take the
            2019 survey.</strong>  All your information for 2019 will be aggregated to the rest of the participants data and

            <strong>As you explore the results</strong> please keep in mind, the intention was for this to be <strong>an open-ended survey.</strong> Our contributors made the 
            sincerest effort to make sure there was no singular agenda or bias at work in the selection of questions. The presentation for the data is
            intended to be similarly neutral. <strong>It's up to the reader to decide what the data might mean</strong> and what conclusions to
            draw.
